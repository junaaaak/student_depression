# Student Depression Analysis

---

This project explores the prevalence and contributing factors to depression among students, utilizing a dataset that includes demographic, academic, and lifestyle variables. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the project identifies key relationships between academic pressure, sleep duration, dietary habits, and depression levels. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights that can inform interventions and support systems aimed at improving student mental health.

## Key Features:
- **Dataset Overview:** Analysis of 27,901 student records with 18 variables.
- **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis:** Investigation of numerical and categorical data distributions, correlations, and depression trends.
- **Outlier Detection:** Identification of anomalies in financial stress and work pressure.
- **Group Aggregations:** Insights on depression levels across various demographic and lifestyle factors.

## Insights:
- High academic and financial stress are associated with increased depression levels.
- Healthy lifestyle habits (sleep, diet) are correlated with lower depression rates.
- Further research can build on these findings to develop targeted interventions.

Feel free to explore the code, data, and findings! Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome.
